# Supply-Chain-Analysis


This repository contains a supply chain analysis project that was done using Python, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The goal of this project was to analyze a supply chain dataset and provide insights to help optimize the supply chain process.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is data about the supply chain of a Fashion and Beauty startup. 

## Requirements
To run the code in this project, you will need to have the following packages installed:

Python 3
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn

## Files
The following files are included in this repository:

Supply chain analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis for the project.
supply_chain_data.csv: CSV file containing the supply chain dataset.

## Running the Code
To run the code in this project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required packages (Python 3, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn).
Open supply_chain_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter notebook.
Run the code cells in the notebook to reproduce the analysis.

## Results
The analysis in this project revealed several insights about the supply chain process, including:

The most popular products and suppliers.
The most profitable products and suppliers.
The correlation between shipping time and customer satisfaction.

## Conclusion
By analyzing the supply chain dataset, we were able to provide valuable insights that can help optimize the supply chain process. These insights can be used to improve customer satisfaction, increase profitability, and streamline operations.
